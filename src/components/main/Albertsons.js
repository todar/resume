          Systems analysis - exploring company systems and infrastructure to
          uncover inefficiencies. My personal analyses has identified and
          reduced 46,000 labor hours annually, or roughly $1,387,727 in annual
          savings.

          Process improvement - building appropriate tools and alternative
          workflows to reduce waste. I have personally saved the company $20
          million since I began in December 2015.

          Overhaul - when it makes sense for the business, I interview primary
          stakeholders, onceptualize the primary goal and re-envision the
          roadmap to accomplishing the task. As an example, Iâ€™ve developed,
          tested, deployed, and continued to track analytics to gain insights on
          vendor cost allowances. This project alone has saved the company over
          70,000 labor hours and has helped increased audit findings in this
          area by more than 60%.

          Integration - recently, I was tasked as lead of systems integration
          for moving all our finacial data and workflow from a legacy Lawson
          system into the Oracle cloud environment.
