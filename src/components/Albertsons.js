    <ListItem>Recognized for development of critical tools and queries and was promoted to Business Analyst
responsible for:
</ListItem>
    <NestedListItem>Systems analysis - exploring company systems and infrastructure to uncover inefficiencies.
My personal analyses has identified and reduced 46,000 labor hours annually, or roughly
$1,387,727 in annual savings.
</NestedListItem>
    <NestedListItem>Process improvement - building appropriate tools and alternative workflows to reduce
waste. I have personally saved the company $20 million since I began in December 2015.</NestedListItem>
    <NestedListItem>Overhaul - when it makes sense for the business, I interview primary stakeholders,
conceptualize the primary goal and re-envision the roadmap to accomplishing the task. As
an example, Iâ€™ve developed, tested, deployed, and continued to track analytics to gain
insights on vendor cost allowances. This project alone has saved the company over 70,000
labor hours and has helped increased audit findings in this area by more than 60%.</NestedListItem>
    <NestedListItem>Integration - recently, I was tasked as lead of systems integration for moving all our
finacial data and workflow from a legacy Lawson system into the Oracle cloud
environment.</NestedListItem>
