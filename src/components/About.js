      <p>
        Have always enjoyed learning and having the ability to build new things
        from the ground up. Previously pursued that desire through construction;
        however, in 2015, began to learn how to program and found it to fulfill
        those desires to an even greater level.
      </p>
      <p>
        First language learned was VBA and has been the primary language used
        over the last five years. Also, have written SQL extensively in DB2. In
        the last two years have been self-learning web development in the
        pursuit of becoming a full-time programmer.
