      <p>
        Have always enjoyed learning and having the ability to build new things
        from the ground up. Previously pursued that desire through construction;
        however, in 2015, began to learn how to program and found it to fulfill
        those desires to an even greater level.
      </p>
      <p>
        First language learned was VBA and has been the primary language used
        over the last five years. Also, have written SQL primaraly in DB2. But where I have found the most enjoyment has been learning and practicing web development.
