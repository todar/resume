  about: `Have always enjoyed learning and having the ability to build new things from the ground up. Previously pursued that desire through construction; however, in 2015, began to learn how to program and found it to fulfill those desires to an even greater level.

First language learned was VBA and has been the primary language used over the last five years. Also, have written SQL primaraly in DB2. But where I have found the most enjoyment has been learning and practicing web development.`,
