# Business Analyst

The lead software developer for internal auditing within product allowances.

- Reviewed a key audit process and identified that a substantial amount of data was being missed by the audit. Implemented new query designs that captured all missing data, resulting in a 60% increase of dollar findings for that audit.

- Created and maintained a system of writing thorough documentation for the coding style guide, best practices, and all release notes.
